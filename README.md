# react-hooks-ex

Created with CodeSandbox initially. This project was for me to learn some basics about the react hooks that I wasn't as familiar with. Then I decided to eventually created an example for each hook type.

## Overview

The components in this app are typically intended to display a single react hook and they are all wrapped in a common higher order component in order to simplify layout and styles for this simple site. Styling is accomplished with CSS Modules due to the fact that they:

1. Allow isolating styles for each particular component
2. Are supported out of the box by create-react-app

## Requirements

The following techology stack is used in this application and must be present on your machine if you wish to build and run locally. - required, \* optional

- \- NodeJS
- \- NPM or Yarn (either/both is fine)
- \* create-react-app

## Getting Started

The main purpose of this app is simply for reference but it is also designed to be run as a single page. To get started you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone ...`
2. Move terminal into the repo directory: `cd react-hooks-ex`
3. Build the source using: `npm install`
4. Execute application using: `npm start`

Open a new browser tab or window and go to the url: <https://localhost:3001>
